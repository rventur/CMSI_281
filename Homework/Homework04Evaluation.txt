Homework04 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment...
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Your code looks great and thanks for doing headers!

These were from Alejandra's repo.

HeapApp.java won't compile.  You have 39 errors in that file,
and it looks like most of them are because you copied the code
from the book and didn't make sure to correct the quotes and
other "non-unicode" characters.  I can't give you credit on
that one.  Process of elimination seems to indicate this was
the string hasher?  I gave you 1/2 credit on it all since you
did have code.

Testing was a little light on the HashProbe, but good enough
to show me it's working.

Folding could use one more test, too, to delete the duplicate
'55451' to prove that the linear probing works properly on
deletion.
