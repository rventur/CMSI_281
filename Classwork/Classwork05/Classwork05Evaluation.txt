======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

EXCELLENT job on test coverage.  You are really getting the
hang of this part of it!  Great idea to check negative values
as well!  I think you're the only one that did it!

"Bob"?  Would you rather I called you that?  I've never asked...

Keep up the good work, sir!  You're doing great.....
